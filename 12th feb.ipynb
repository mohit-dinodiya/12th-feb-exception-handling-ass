    "# what is exception in python?write the differnces between exception and syntax error?\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of a program is disrupted, and Python raises an exception object.\n",
    "\n",
    "SyntaxError is a specific type of exception that occurs when there is a syntax error in the program code. Syntax errors are errors in the syntax of the program, such as missing parentheses, commas, or quotation marks. These errors prevent the program from being executed by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter when it tries to compile the program code before executing it. Exceptions, on the other hand, are raised during the execution of the program, when something unexpected happens, such as trying to divide by zero or accessing a variable that has not been defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are typically easier to fix than exceptions. Syntax errors can be fixed by correcting the syntax of the program code, while exceptions require more careful analysis and debugging to identify the root cause of the problem and fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while syntax errors are a specific type of error that occurs before a program is executed due to incorrect syntax, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program when something unexpected happens. Both are important types of errors that programmers need to be aware of and address in their Python code."
